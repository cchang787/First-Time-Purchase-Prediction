# First-Time Purchase Prediction
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict which users will make a first-time purchase based on the user's activities. Another objective is to determine which activities contribute the most in predicting whether a user will make a purchase. 

The data is pulled from raw logs and contains 4,918,677 rows and 3 columns:
- *user_id*: A hash that uniquely identifies the user
- *activity_date*: The date of the activity
- *activity_type*: The type of activity
